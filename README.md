# Multiagent Workflow with GPT-4 Integrated Streamlit App

## Introduction

This project demonstrates a multiagent workflow system integrated with GPT-4 and visualized using a Streamlit app. It leverages a combination of technologies, including Matplotlib for plotting, NetworkX for graph operations, and OpenAI's GPT-4 for generating and evaluating Python code based on user queries. The system facilitates a feedback loop where user input influences the decision-making process within a defined state graph, optimizing query handling and code generation over time.
